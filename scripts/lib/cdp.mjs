// with real input means owning the whole machine for the length of the shoot,
// and one stray click ruins the take. CDP talks to the browser over a socket,
// so the page scrolls and clicks while the window sits there unfocused and the
// person at the desk carries on with another monitor.
//
// Nothing is installed for this. Node 24 ships WebSocket and fetch, and the
// protocol is the browser's own, which is what keeps this inside the rule about
// keeping the browser under program control rather than under a mouse.
